<h4><b>About the B.Voc. Course</b><hr></h4><br>
<p class="justifier">
    B.Voc. (Bachelor of Vocational Degree) courses are available in several fields for students who have completed their 12th standard or equivalent. This is largely targeted towards youth who want to enhance their employability opportunities to learn, earn and grow. The advantage of these courses is that as against common Degree courses like Engineering or B.Com. or B.Sc, there are multiple exit points and continued exposure to the industry. The work experience increases the student’s chances of landing a job.<br>

<br>The advantages of B.Voc. courses are that they help ensure the learners have adequate skills, make them work-ready and enhance the employability of the graduate students. A unique feature of the curriculum is the blend of vocational and business management concepts. This higher education system incorporates the requirements of various industries in a flexible manner which develops holistic and well–groomed graduates thus meeting the emerging needs of the economy.<br>

<br>The University Grants Commission (UGC) has launched this scheme on skills development based higher education as part of College/University education, leading to Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc.) degree with multiple exits such as Diploma/Advanced Diploma under the NSQF.  The B.Voc. programme is focused on universities and Colleges providing undergraduate studies which would also incorporate specific job roles along with broad based general education. This would enable the graduates completing B.Voc.to make meaningful participation in accelerating India’s economy by gaining appropriate employment, becoming entrepreneurs and creating appropriate knowledge.<br>

<br>The details of B.Voc. courses offered by the College are given below.
